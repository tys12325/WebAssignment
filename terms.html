            of your order takes place when we email you to confirm we&#39ve dispatched your product(s). It&#39s at this point that a contract

            how we are performing and when you decide to end the contract, as set out below. We&#39re under a legal duty to 
            supply products that are in conformity with this contract and nothing in these terms will affect your legal rights.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>6.2 If what you have bought is faulty or differs substantially from how it is described on our website or our app </strong>

            which you received when buying the product. We will make any refunds due to you as soon as possible. If you are exercising 
            your right to change your mind, your refund will be made within 14 days from the day we receive the unused product back from you.

            <strong>9.4 What happens if we get the price wrong.</strong>
            It is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the products we sell may be incorrectly priced. 
            We will normally check prices before accepting your order so that, if the product&#39s correct price at your order date is 
            less than our stated price at your order date, we will charge the lower amount. If we accept and process your order 
            where a pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could reasonably have been recognised by you as a mispricing, 
            we may end the contract, refund you any sums you have paid and require the return of any products provided to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>9.5 When you must pay and how you must pay.</strong>
            We accept payment by Visa, Mastercard, American Express, PayPal and Apple Pay. We will not charge you until we dispatch 
            the products to you, although the price payable by you for the products may appear as pending transactions against the payment method you use.
        </p>
        <p>

            our breaking this contract or our failing to use reasonable care and skill, but we are not responsible for any loss or damage 
            that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time the contract

            We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to another organisation. We will contact you to let you know if
            we plan to do this. If you are unhappy with the transfer, you may contact us to end the contract within seven days of us 
            telling you about it and we will refund you any payments you have made in advance for products not provided.
        </p>

            <strong>13.2 You need our consent to transfer your rights to someone else.</strong>

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>13.3 Nobody else has any rights under this contract.</strong>

            <strong>13.4 We may change these terms at any time.</strong>

            If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking 
            steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract,that will not mean that you do not have to do those things 
            and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.
        </p>


        <div class="underline"><p><strong>14. Terms relevant when you purchase in one of our physical stores.</strong></p></div>
        <p>If you purchase products from us in one of our physical stores:</p>
        <p>14.1 Except for products which have been personalised, our goodwill returns policy means that you can return your item in store 
            within 30 days of the date of purchase. Please return the item unused, with all its packaging and labelling intact and with your
            original receipt or e-receipt and we will refund you the price you paid for the products by the method you used for payment.
            For purchases made by part-card and part-gift card, the refund will be applied to the gift card first. If you used a discount code
            to buy the product, the amount refunded will be reduced to take into account the benefit of any discount which you received when
            buying the product. If it is not possible for us to provide a refund via the method you used for payment, we will provide a gift 
            voucher to the equivalent value or you may exchange the item for an item which is the same price (subject to availability in store).
        </p>
        <p>14.2 Our goodwill returns policy does not apply to products falling within the categories set out in clauses 6.4.1 &#8208 6.4.5 above, 
            including items which we have personalised for you or to items which are sealed for health protection or hygiene purposes 
            once they have been unsealed after purchase.
        </p>
        <p>14.3 If you have provided your e-mail address to us at the point of purchase, you can also use our usual Happy Returns process. 
            This is outlined at: aboutus.ht</p>
        <p>14.4 Statutory Rights: Our returns policy does not affect any statutory rights that you have as a consumer.</p>
